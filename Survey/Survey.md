# Certified marketplace actions

In this file, we describe a survey that was conducted in order to understand the state-of-the-art of the problem. To do this survey, we investigated actions that were published in the [Github marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=) under the section *testing* and took into consideration only those whose creator is certified. In total in the Github marketplace, there are 762 actions, but merely 18 are verified. 

The picture below shows a set of the actions that were analyzed in the survey. The information that we retrieved for each action is URL, action name, description, creator and review. The full table can be found [here](https://github.com/FiorelaCiroku/testmanagement/blob/main/Survey/Test%20automation%20Survey.xlsx).
